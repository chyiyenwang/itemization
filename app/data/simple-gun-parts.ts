          "This is a medium-class drone, easily recognizable by the pair of armored rotors mounted prominently on its front. It rarely operates alone, preferring to patrol the skies alongside a swarm of Wasps or to act as an aerial shield for a larger, ground-based ARC. Its main attack is a focused, high-speed projectile. Watch for the brief, one-second pulse of a red aiming laser—that's your warning before it fires a specialized stun round designed to shred Raider shields and tear through light armor almost instantly.",

          "This is a small, unarmored turret that provides close-quarters defense for the ARC. Its primary function is to scan constantly for movement, and you’ll typically find it mounted on interior walls inside buildings. Do not confuse this swift little gun with the massive, high-altitude Sentinel turrets you find outside. When it spots a Raider, it immediately opens fire, unleashing a two-second hail of bullets in an attempt to suppress and eliminate the threat quickly. Its lack of armor makes it fragile, but its location makes it dangerous.",
