This unit is designed to saturate an area, turning cover into a liability and forcing Raiders to constantly relocate or be wiped out by the sheer force of its explosions.

Be warned, however, its most unique (and dangerous) trait is its resilience: as it takes damage, its outer shell breaks apart into many smaller, armored pieces. Its final attack is a relentless one: it will roll directly at high speed toward any Raider it detects, essentially turning itself into a giant, high-impact bowling ball.",

Its incredible durability and lethal arsenal make it the single greatest threat on the map; attempting to scratch its armor alone is a fool's errand—you'll need a full squad of Raiders working in concert just to stand a chance.\n\nIts attacks are devastating:\n\nMortar Barrage: The dome atop the unit launches three massive mortars that land in a cluster around a targeted Raider. Two seconds after impact, they detonate in a fiery, engulfing inferno.\n\nSustained Laser: It periodically sweeps its primary weapon, firing a continuous laser beam at any Raider it acquires in its line-of-sight.\n\nClose-Quarters Deterrents: Should Raiders try to get up close and personal, the Goliath switches modes, delivering either a disruptive EMP pulse to shut down technology or a crushing ground slam to obliterate anything nearby.",
